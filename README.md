# VocalPoint: AI Energy-Based Scheduler

A privacy-first mobile application that replaces traditional time-blocking with energy-blocking. Users record brief, stream-of-consciousness audio logs throughout their day. The app uses on-device AI to analyze vocal biomarkers (tone, pace, prosody) and semantic context to quantify cognitive load and emotional energy levels. It then connects to calendar APIs to dynamically rearrange task lists and meeting suggestions, ensuring high-focus work is scheduled during peak energy windows and administrative tasks are offloaded to detected low-energy periods.
